/**
 * MAIN 2048 GAME COMPONENT
 *
 * This is the main component that orchestrates the entire 2048 game.
 * It follows the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing on coordinating
 * between different parts of the game rather than implementing game logic itself.
 *
 * Think of this as the "conductor" of an orchestra - it doesn't play any instruments
 * itself, but it coordinates all the different parts to create a harmonious experience.

 * MAIN GAME COMPONENT

 * - Game logic and state management

 * 1. Uses custom hooks to manage game state and input
 * 2. Provides feedback to the user through toast notifications
 * 3. Renders the game board and controls
 * 4. Coordinates between all the different parts
